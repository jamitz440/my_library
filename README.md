# My Library

## The Plan
So, it all started as my wife wanted an easy way to see what books she had on her TBR ( To Be Read ) list. She found goodreads far too complicated and didnt want to use even half the features they have on there. 
This is where my libry comes in, A simple, easy to use home library management app.
